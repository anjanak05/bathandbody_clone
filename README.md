We have used HTML, CSS and java script to build this website along with grid and flex to minimize code writing and array of object model/API to store/retrieve data easily .

The website starts with a landing Page(Home Page) which consists of navigation bars(i.e header and footer). Header has all the options to go for subcategories and visit respective pages along search bar and sign in and and cart page button at the top. Talking about footer, it has all the links to various pages that provides information about our websites and link to various social media.

The website lets you sign-in using sign-in page, if your do not have account then it lets you to sign-up first.

After sign-in, we can add products from various product pages to cart page, in product pages we have added a functionality to sort and filter data as per high or low prices. Product page has a button which lets you add any particular product top to the cart.

Cart page has all the products you moved to cart from product page and it shows the no of items in the cart along with the total price and a proceed to payment page button.

Payment pages has all the field for card details and address details, enter all the details to move ahead with payment.

After successful payment we will get a confirmation of successful payment along with an order number
